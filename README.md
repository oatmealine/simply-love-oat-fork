![logo triplet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NyaightHazard/simply-love-oat-fork/nyaightz-edit/logo.png "logo")

A fork of [SimplyLove (Oat vs Rya's Fork)](https://github.com/oatmealine/simply-love-oat-fork), which is a fork of [SimplyLove-NotITG](https://github.com/TaroNuke/Simply-Love-NotITG-ver.-).
It's why also called Fork'n'Fork EDIT.

The objective is keeping sync source changes but also adding more custom for personal (means **me**). 
So, this contains experimental features or some *less* funny.

## Features

Almost features are same to Oat vs Rya's Fork ***BUT***

- *!!* I reconvert Japanese/Korean/Chinese fonts for some reasons
- *!* Change the sort of FailOverlay: YouDied, Go2Brazil, Wasted, the rest are same. So default FailOverlay becomes to YouDied.
- *!* Change the default judgement font: SimplyLove-NotITG's one but aligned in center
- Add `0 - enable restart` folder that makes enable to use "Restart Game"!
- Add "QwertyJP" layout of debug console for Japanese keyboard (106/109 keys)
- Change the logo, window icon, and system message frame ... to <span style="color:#4CB219">green</span>
- Some places use old_wendy system font, classical SimplyLove-NotITG's font
- Less confusing Select Mode Screen
- Show "GET READY" and song details on Song Transition
- Press Action7 (default: keyboard 7) to RETRY on Result!
- Show both PB itself and difference from score on Result
- A bit bigger "Personal Record" text on Result
- Rate bar of each judgement timing on Result (Optional)
- Fake "FAILED" effect instead of "CLEARED" for fail grade on Result (Optional)

## How to enable Restart

PLEASE READ `0 - enable restart/readme.txt`<br>
AND FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY

In short, after put this theme in your NotITG, just run `0 - enable restart/Enable_Restart.bat`.

## Note about QwertyJP

You can use this by changing the value of layout on `NotITG-v***/Data/config.lua` to "QwertyJP".

Almost keyboard symbols can work as-is, but somes cannot work (says '?').
So, I set special shortcut with "QwertyJP":
```
Shift+0 = :
Alt+1 = ^
Alt+2 = ~
Alt+3 = |
Alt+4 = @
Alt+5 = `
Alt+6 = *
```
