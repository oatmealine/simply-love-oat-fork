![logo triplet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NyaightHazard/simply-love-oat-fork/nyaightz-edit/logo.png "logo")

A fork of [SimplyLove (Oat vs Rya's Fork)](https://github.com/oatmealine/simply-love-oat-fork), which is a fork of [SimplyLove-NotITG](https://github.com/TaroNuke/Simply-Love-NotITG-ver.-).
It's why also called Fork'n'Fork EDIT.

The objective is keeping sync source changes, but adding more custom for personal (means **me**). 
So, this contains experimental features or some *less* funny.

## Features

Almost features are same to Oat vs Rya's Fork ***BUT***

- *!!* I reconvert Japanese/Korean/Chinese fonts for some reasons
- *!* Change the sort of FailOverlay: YouDied, Go2Brazil, Wasted, the rest are same. So default FailOverlay becomes to YouDied.
- *!* Change the default judgement font: SimplyLove-NotITG's one but aligned in center
- Add `0 - enable restart` folder that makes enable to use "Restart Game"
- Change the logo and window icon
- Some places use old_wendy system font, classically SimplyLove-NotITG's font
- Less confusing Select Mode Screen
- Show "GET READY" and song details on Song Transition
- Show both PB itself and difference from score on Result
- A bit bigger "Personal Record" text on Result
- Rate bar of each judgement timing on Result (Optional)
- Fake "FAILED" effect instead of "CLEARED" for fail grade on Result (Optional)
