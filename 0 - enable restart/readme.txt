You know, this theme has "Restart Game" option in title.
Only works on Windows, but some useful stuff.

However, to use restart, you must put path of exe in about middle of "metrics.ini".
A bit of pain, isn't it?

So I make "Enable_Restart.bat".

Usage is simple.
After put this theme in your NotITG, just run "Enable_Restart.bat".
That's all.

PS: This requires PowerShell, so Windows Vista, XP, or older will fail
